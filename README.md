# Jast

## The rundown
Jast is a WordPress theme framework all about simplicity. Just what you need, none of what you don't.

## Installation
Git clone Jast into the `themes` directory. Use find and replace to change all instances of `jast` to whatever you want to call your theme.

## How to use
Jast is not meant to be a parent theme for child theme development. It's meant to be hacked on, broken, fixed, re-broken, re-fixed and made awesomer. Go crazy.
